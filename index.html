 <p><strong>Bobby</strong> is a very big idiot that loves to eat human food<br>He is covered in
	 <em>fluff</em>, with <em>orange, white and black coloring</em> all over his body
	 <br>His ears have an adorable coloration as they are the only place you see black (besides on his nose).</p>

	 <h2> Behavior </h2>
	 <p>This ball of fluff can be found in my back yard back home and is one of a kind. 
		 <br>He can often be seen sunbathing while laying in the snow because he does not understand
		 the concept of cold or hot.
		  <br>While in the yard he is the most spoiled dog, often rubbing against people`s legs
		  without realising that he is huge. This often leads to people falling down due to his weight.
		His favourite thing to do is to beg for food whenever he sees his owners eat
		.<br> His favourite food is meatballs.</p>
